# Iteration 2 Plan

### High priority use cases
- Show tutorial:
  - Criticality: Makes game much easier to understand and interact with
  - Risk: N/A
  - Coverage: Helps other use cases, but they work without it

### Low priority use cases
Customize character
- Criticality: Increases replayability and player enjoyment
- Risk: Might be difficult to implement
- Coverage: Helps other use cases, but they work without it

### Other high priority considerations
- Adapting our code to work with Android (changing the UI)
- Need to write our story and implement it
- Add more enemies with different stats and behavior
  - Certain enemies might have different behavior when resolving moves
  - This will be decided during the next iteration
- Balance Player and Enemy statistics so that combats are more fair/enjoyable (this will be an ongoing process as game development continues)
