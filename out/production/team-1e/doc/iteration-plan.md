# Iteration Plan

### High priority use cases:
- Fight
  - Criticality: Main selling point of the game
  - Risk: Difficult to implement later
  - Coverage: Most use cases need it in order to work
- Upgrade Stats
  - Criticality: Adds replayability to the game, makes the game more fun, makes the player feel like they are progressing
  - Risk: Difficult to implement later, but easy to update or make more complicated
  - Coverage: Most use cases need it in order to work
- Return to beginning
  - Criticality: Determines the gameplay loop
  - Risk: Difficult to implement later
  - Coverage: Other high priority use cases rely on it
- Present story
  - Criticality: Adds interest to the game and gives more reason to play it
  - Risk: Difficult to add later
  - Coverage: Other high priority use cases rely on it

### Medium priority use cases:
- Show tutorial
  - Criticality: Makes game much easier to understand and interact with
  - Risk: N/A
  - Coverage: Helps other use cases, but they work without it

### Low priority use cases:
- Customize character
  - Criticality: Increases replayability and player enjoyment
  - Risk: Might be difficult to implement
  - Coverage: Helps other use cases, but they work without it

### Extra ideas we might implement
- Can add more enemy types with more complicated implementation and interaction with player
- Can add a speed stat that determines move order during __Fight__ and adds additional options during __Upgrade stats__
